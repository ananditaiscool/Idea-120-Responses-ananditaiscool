According to O'Neil, Chalabi, and Gayomali data and algortihms are used to influence media consumers. Companies 
and governemnt use data to mislead and misrepresent issues to their own benefit through "lead generators" which could be seen in the Trump 
Administration during the 2016 election. In return, companies like Facebook gain wealth based off of targeted
advertising which was metioned by O'Neil. These advertsiments are created to polarize public opinion and are used 
inaccurately, skewing the validity of facts. Targeted ads can also be seen in instances of data collection through 
search history, voice conversations, etc which allow media apps to offer specifc ads to fix an issue or a want of consumers.
They use sing consumers lives and insecurities against them in an effort to increase wealth and user activity. Clickbait is another example. 
Gayomali discusses a subtle way in which user interface is deisgned to shape interactions using typeface, colors, and imagery. 
All of these aspects are to be expected as consequences of using the internet as it has grown into a multifaced entity. 

One can argue that these tools are useful in collecting data, which I would agree with. However, tools give off a dystopian affect 
of being controlled or watched which is not a comfortable thought. Company's like Facebook and Instagram may believe it to be 
essential even but they are the ones monotarily benefiting from targeted ads. Alternativly it would be helpful for content creators 
to have their content be more noticed through brand deals. A consumer may also find it useful to be able to surf the 
web  with more direction and guidance. Interface design seems ot be a more harmeless aspect of media tools and without it the internet may not be as interactive 
or interesting to view. 

The nature of these tools are not egalitarian, they give companies an upper hand in marketing and influencing taking away from small 
businesses and creators. Corporations are feeding off of us monotarily and consumers grow while sadder and poorer due to excess spending and 
mental illness. This benefits the rich more than it does the working class consumers which is directly non-egalitarian. Additionally these 
tools use our information without our knowledge and use them against us. They have devastaing consequenses like shaking 
presidential and local elections which change the future for several groups. However, a complete egaliitarian view point can not be taken by 
for-profit apps and companies due to their inherint need to produce under capitalism. These methods are flawed in the same way all human made systems
are.
