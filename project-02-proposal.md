For my project I would like to create a 1 minute video where the background is me swimming underwater.  I will use a video of me swimming
and add that to a green screen of an underwater scene with text that will include narration.

Jared's reply:
This sounds quite surreal to have you swimming in the background, especially since you will be in the foreground on Zoom. If you plan to use Adobe Premiere to edit your video, you may want to look at our workshop from last Tuesday (https://vimeo.com/469623026/c0871dccff) that incorporates cutting out images in Photoshop and adding them in front of a playing video to create a virtual environment. I imagine something like a viewing window, or a portal window that you are in front of while you swim in the background. I'm curious what the narration will be - during the critique as the text and video will be in your background, will you perform with the narration and video? Is there an interplay between your two bodies (your foreground body on Zoom and your background swimming body)? Looking forward to seeing this! Let me know if you have questions.
