While the tinternet has much to offer it also has serious issues within it. The author uses the case of childrens content on youtube 
as a case study for understanding the misuse of the internet. He describes the relationship between children and computer and 
symbiotic which leads them vulnerable to inappropriate content which may be hidden in the algorithm. Not only do young children build 
an addiction early on but children content draws in parents as well. We assume that the internet is a safe and true place when in reality
there are several predetors and problematic people on the internet making content that exploits childen and creates a traumatic environemnt.
 
Bridle mention the blurring of the line between human and machine which creates a push and pull affect that draws viewers back despite knowing 
the dangers. He recognizes how the sytstem is complicit in showing violence and the lack of human checking is harmful but also recognizes how it 
is almost impossible to fact-check everything. I agree that we have created a world that we are too reliant on the internet but are also unable 
to fully control it. We must activly recognize the damage done, hold accountability for creators and companies, for exmaple facebook, as well as 
hold self responsibility for putting far too much faith in the system.
