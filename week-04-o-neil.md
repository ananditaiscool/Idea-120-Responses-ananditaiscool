O'Neil describes "WMD" as "Weapons of Mass of Math Destruction". She uses this terminology to identify issues 
withen the world of data science, specifically how data can be used to hurt others, even if they do not know 
they are being hurt by it. The author defines how data is used to create mathmatical models that depict 
the likelyhood of an event happening and thus create an outcome based on the variables of data collected 
overtime. O'Neil uses example ssuch as employers using credit scores in the hiring process with the model that 
those who have ahigher score are more likely to be better employees. Another is the example of school districts 
using standardized tests to decide which school and teachers should remain working. This model is created on the 
data that students who have hiring test scores are learning more and thus smarter and more deserving. Both these 
models however fit into O'Neils arguemnt that these data oreinted outcomes fail to recognize human value and can 
seriously impact huamn life for exmaple if you have a low credit score you may not get the job you wish to have 
and you may continue in the cycle of poverty without a way out. Or school that are shut down due to low scores 
now create communities with a low education and employment rate severly damaging the livlihood of that neighborhood 
and future community funding. 

Another example of WMD is Facebook. Facebook in the last few years has gotten major pushback becasue of a multitude 
of issues. Specifically, the ways in which Facebook uses WMD is by boosting hate crime related videos and using data 
to formulate adds. The website's algorithm, boosts posts that get more likes and shares but this function has been known 
to be used by people like armed shooters and hateful people who take advantage of this model and lack of human content checkers 
to spread ignorance and harmful material. This can be seen in the New Zealand Mosque Shooting in 2019 where the assailant used 
Facebook to livestream his attack and was viewed but thousands of people before being taken down. Facebook played a role in the spread 
of Islamaphobia and white supremacy which has a serious affect on peoples well being. These kind of posts can increase suicide rates in 
young people and mental illness leaving casualities as mentioned in paragraph five. 

Additionally, Facebook and other apps use our information, through phones even when we are not using them, as models for what we will 
interact with online. Similar to how if you say something near your phone you may see ads for the same objects later in the day. This may not 
seem to have a great negative impact but it goes to show how much data our phones and app pick up without our knowledge and with invasion 
of our privacy. Some of us know we are being studied and our information is being spread around the interweb and yet we still 
use it based on the dependency it creates because it knows so much about us. For instance notifications for things like peoples birthdays we 
forget about. So much data exists on Facebook alone that it is almost impossible for the system to be fully fact checked and 
censor bad posts so  while everything is set in a structured data driven manner for ease of programmers and businnes it poses equally 
important difficulties for users.
