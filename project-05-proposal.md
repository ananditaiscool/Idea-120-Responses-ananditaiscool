In my portfolio project I would include project 1,2,4 and 2 illustrator drawings that I have created this 
semester. All of these works show ways I have used software to create expand my art practice. They will be displayed 
on one page which will begin with an image of myself and a personal bio. Below that will be screenshots or videos, of 
the art work and on the left side there will be an artist statement or description of the work. I would like to 
focus. I would like the color scheme to be warm autumnal tones or neutrals, brown, taupe, tan, etc. I would like to expand 
my knowledge and use of typography and possible use illustrator to include doodles or hand drawn style elements.
