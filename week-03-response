  Roland Barthes, "Rhetoric of the Image", discusses the three types of messages found in images which are linguistic message, 
coded iconic message, and non-coded iconic message. While this image of Kylie Jenner, a famous instagram influencer, may seem simple, 
it actually has several hidden messages in within it. The linguistic message is clear, that drinking this tea will help one detox in a short 
short amount of time and that Jenner enjoys drinking it. The coded iconic message is that if you drink it, the viewer can also have a body 
and lifestyle like her. The non-coded message is establishing a standard of beauty filled with diets and detoxes to seem healthier and trendier.
