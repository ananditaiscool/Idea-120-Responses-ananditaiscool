Nakamurs' citation of Lev Manovich can be understood as the viewer interacting with the media in a 
way that involves putting themselves in the deisgners shoes and seeing the context of the work 
as they would. Coding is like a language, and each of us speak in a unique was, similarly deisgner 
use their coding to depict a certian message. "To identify with someone else's mental structure" is like a 
relationship between an artist and the art, the artist puts their mind, body, and soul, 
into a work, which is a reflection of themselves which one activly takes part in. "Identiy toursim" allows 
viewers to step into a different personas across racial, gendered, class-based realms. One can "step into the artwork" 
and its visual aethetic  and understand their message or theme by being part of the "gaze" as Nakamura mentions.

Tinder is an interesting example of understanding the "mental structure" of the designer. The interface puts  
possible matches front and center depicting the importance of the face and body in finding a match. The deisgner could have 
prioritized written bios but they chose faces to decipher elegibility. Then you have two options, swipe left or right, showing
the designers fast paced ability to pick based on looks. The app is similar to how people would appears in your eye sight in a 
public place, previously where people went to find dates. The alternate page consists of every match one makes, similar to how one 
would "rake" through their brain to remmeber someone they talked to or connected with. It is possible that there may be a gendered 
element as well, the app icon is pink which is stereotyplically associaged with women but using color theory can make apps
more desirable to specific audiences.
