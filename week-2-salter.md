<p>In "Entangled: Technology and the Tranformation of Performance" by Chris Salter, Salter discusses the 
ideology of a German composer name Richard Wagner known as "Gesamtkunstwerk". This concept signifys the creation of 
a work by an artist that uses various elements of art to create an enitre piece. It visualizes the artist as having the power
to complete mutiple task at once and has full control over the creation of each element of their work. Wagner made a lasting 
impression on the creative world, artists in every generation have sought to emulate his style of creation in which where each deisgn aspect 
would rely on the other in order to create a successful art expereince using the new technologies that emerge. </p>

<p>The tools necessary to create "Gesamtkunstwerk" in contemporary society could be endless. It would intergrate traditional fine arts,
digital media and manipulation, interaction, and much more. The idea would be to contain as many aspects of the art practice 
into a single piece as possible from its start to its end like sound, touch, visuals, tastes, all of which can be used to interactt
with one another to create a single art piece which is what is done in performance art many times. This is similar to the concept of 
"built environments" from Week 1. Tools that can be used in contemporary art would be coding, technology, sound production,
etc. Examples of this kind of art would include video games, 3d or 4d movies, fashion shows, and even architecture. As the 
definitions of art has grown larger artists are able to create with more technology </p> 

<p>In the Rhizome's Anthology an example that of "Gesantkunstwerk" is 386 DX. The art work pulls together sound engineerings,
specific locations, and public interface and experience to explore the definition of "live music" and creates an expereince 
of art rather than a singular object. One can imagine that each passerbyer would have a different experience of the music
based on the quality of their day, or even the natural elements of the weather. Garlic=Rich Air also does somethign similar
by creating an interactive artwork that both lives on one style of art work, digital, but it also expressed though the moving 
truck which is the physical. </p>
