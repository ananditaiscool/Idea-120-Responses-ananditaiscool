My non-linear narrative will be a short story about a duck that wants to cross the road. It is a 
play off the chicken crossing the road question and leads to alternative endings based on the 
viewers decisions. It uses a sarcastic tone to build a sort of narration but will follow the duck 
from one side of the road to the other, or not, it may die at some point, which would cause the viewer
to restart. The story line will be depicted in illustrations I will create in Adobe Fresco and add to 
the page itself.  Each potential answer will be a link to the next option or part of the story.

Jared's response:
I'm excited about the use of this classic joke with so many variations as the framework for your game. Of course, there are infinite versions of the chicken crossing the road joke - and many of them have a nonsensical or deceptively insightful ending. I wonder how you could use the complexity that Twine allows (variables, moving from narrative to narrative instead of sticking with one track) in order to emulate and then expand on that unexpected ending in the chicken-joke milieu. Additionally, one of the reasons that the chicken jokes work so well is that they are almost always linguistic/textual only - they let us create the absurdity of the scene and lean on the listener's associations of what each element of the joke invokes. Using illustrations in your game will need to be done in a way that they don't detract from the linguistic message, or contradict it (unless this is part of the use of the illustration). Also, who are we in the story? Chicken? Third party observer? The road itself? I think positioning the player with great intention will do a lot to drive your game home.

Can't wait to see it!
