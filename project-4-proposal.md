My non-linear narrative will be a short story about a duck that wants to cross the road. It is a 
play off the chicken crossing the road question and leads to alternative endings based on the 
viewers decisions. It uses a sarcastic tone to build a sort of narration but will follow the duck 
from one side of the road to the other, or not, it may die at some point, which would cause the viewer
to restart. The story line will be depicted in illustrations I will create in Adobe Fresco and add to 
the page itself.  Each potential answer will be a link to the next option or part of the story.
